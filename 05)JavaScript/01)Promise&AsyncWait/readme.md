## Promises and Async/Await in JavaScript

### Promises
A `Promise` in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner, more robust way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions.

A promise can be in one of three states:
- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

Here's an example of creating and using a promise:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Operation Successful!");
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result); // "Operation Successful!"
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});
```
## Async and Await in JavaScript

### Async
The `async` keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function is a function that operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit `Promise` to return its result. However, the `async` keyword allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable, synchronous-like manner.

When a function is declared with `async`, it automatically returns a `Promise`. If the function returns a value, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise. If the function throws an error, it returns a rejected promise.

Example:

```javascript
async function greet() {
  return "Hello, World!";
}

greet().then(message => console.log(message)); // "Hello, World!"
```

### Await
The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved or rejected, allowing you to work with asynchronous code as if it were synchronous.

When `await` is used, it returns the fulfilled value of the promise or throws an error if the promise is rejected.
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

### Summary
- **`async`**: Declares a function as asynchronous, ensuring it returns a promise.
- **`await`**: Pauses the execution of an async function until the promise is resolved, allowing for more readable and maintainable asynchronous code.

By using `async` and `await`, you can manage asynchronous operations more effectively in JavaScript, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
