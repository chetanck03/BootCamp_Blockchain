## Task 9 :

To complete this challenge, you have to create a structure USER in which you will create two fields - id(uint) and name(string). Then create a dynamic array of USER type to insert the name and id of a user.

- insert() - To insert a user in the USER array. This function will take one argument name(string type).

- read(uint id) - This will return the user name and id.

- find(uint id ) - To find a user in the USER array based on the user id. If the user does not exist then revert with 'User does not exist!' .

## Note : 
Initialize a counter by one and increment it every time when a new user is added to the array. This counter variable will be the id of the User Id.
