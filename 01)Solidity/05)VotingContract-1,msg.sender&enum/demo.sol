/*

 1) msg.sender :
   ->  A global variable representing the address of the entity (person or smart contract) that called the current function.
   ->  Commonly used for access control, ensuring only authorized addresses can execute certain functions.
   -> Example :
            function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public {
                require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer funds");
                // Transfer logic
            }

 2) block.timestamp :
   -> A global variable in Solidity that returns the current blockâ€™s timestamp in Unix time (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).
   -> Used to get the exact time at which the block was mined, providing a way to timestamp events or implement time-dependent logic in smart contracts.
   -> Example :   
       require(block.timestamp >= startTime, "Function can only be called after start time");

 3) enum :
   -> A user-defined type in Solidity that represents a set of named values, which are called members. Enums are used to create custom types with a finite set of possible values
   -> Enhances code readability and maintainability by giving descriptive names to integer values, making the code more self-explanatory
   -> Example :  
        enum Role { User, Admin, SuperAdmin }
        Role public userRole;

        function setRole(Role _role) public {
                userRole = _role;
        }
