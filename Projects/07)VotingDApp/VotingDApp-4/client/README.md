# Project Overview

## Install the Required Packages:

- Install the following package for making HTTP requests:
  ```
  npm i axios
  ```

## Server Connection and Token Creation:

- In the `getWeb3State` file, implement logic to generate a token. This involves:
  - Signing a message using the `signMessage` function from the connected Web3 wallet.
  - Sending the signature to your server through an API request.
  - Storing the received token in the local storage for later use.

## Fetching the Token:

- Once the token is stored in local storage (after user authentication), you can retrieve it when needed.
- In the `pages` folder, specifically in the `RegisterCandidate.jsx` file, implement logic to fetch the token from local storage to authenticate further API requests.
