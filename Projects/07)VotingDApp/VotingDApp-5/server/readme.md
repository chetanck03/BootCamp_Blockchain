## Storing Images on the Server:

### 1) Multer Setup:
- Create a `multer.js` file to handle and store images using Multer.
    ```
    npm i multer
    ```
- Integrate Multer into the `candidateRoutes.js` file located in the `routes` folder for handling candidate image uploads.
- Create a `votingSystem` folder inside the `CandidateImages` directory to store uploaded candidate images.

### 2) Voter Image Upload Function:
- Create the `VoterSchema` and set up the `VoterRoutes` for managing voter data and image uploads.
- Update the voter router in the `index.js` file to handle voter-related routes.
- Create a `votingSystem` folder inside the `VoterImages` directory to store uploaded voter images.
