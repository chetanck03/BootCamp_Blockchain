# Rust Programming Language

Rust is a modern programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. It is fast, memory-efficient, and guarantees memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Rust is ideal for building reliable and efficient software, ranging from system-level applications to web applications.

## Key Features

- **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++.
- **Memory Safety**: No null or dangling pointers.
- **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency with ownership and type-checking.
- **Community Support**: Active community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
- **Cargo**: Built-in package manager and build system.

## Why Choose Rust?

- Ensures **safety** by preventing segmentation faults.
- **Zero-cost abstractions** allow developers to write high-level code without sacrificing performance.
- Integrated tools for **testing, documentation, and building** projects.
- Strong support for **embedded programming** and **WebAssembly**.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Rust using the official Rust installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, verify it with:

```bash
rustc --version
```

### First Program

Create a file `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```
